======
* Ph.D in Machine Learning, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, 2024
* M.S. in Mathematics, AMU, India, 2018
* B.S. in Mathematics, AMU, India, 2016

Work experience
======
* 2021 - 2024 Thesis: Development of adaptive threshold and graph-based methods for electroencephalogram channel selection in brain-computer interface.
  * Developed an adaptive threshold-based method integrated with a modified Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to enhance EEG channel selection in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. This approach 
    achieved significant improvements in accuracy, reaching 93.90% with the k-adaptEEGCS model and 95.60% with the G-EEGCS model.
